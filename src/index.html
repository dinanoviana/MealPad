                    <p>A meal is an eating occasion that takes place at a certain time and includes prepared food. The
                        names used for specific meals in English vary, depending on the speaker's culture, the time
                        of day, or the size of the meal.</p>
                    <p>Meals occur primarily at homes, restaurants, and cafeterias, but may occur anywhere. Regular
                        meals occur on a daily basis, typically several times a day. Special meals are usually held in
                        conjunction with such occasions as birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, and holidays. A meal is
                        different from a snack in that meals are generally larger, more varied, and more filling than
                        snacks.</p>
                    <p>The type of meal served or eaten at any given time varies by custom and location. In most modern
                        cultures, three main meals are eaten: in the morning, early afternoon, and evening. Further, the
                        names of meals are often interchangeable by custom as well. Some serve dinner as the main meal
                        at midday, with supper as the late afternoon/early evening meal; while others may call their
                        midday meal lunch and their early evening meal supper. Except for "breakfast", these names can
                        vary from region to region or even from family to family.</p>
